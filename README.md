# blockchain_python
The github repository contains a basic implementation of a blockchain.

# Code implementation contains

# Part 1 - Building a Blockchain
By creating Blockchain class that has the main params/data_variables and the main functionality related to the blockchain it's self.

# Main params/data_variables of Blockchain class
1- chain list:: wich is the list will be updated every time you mine a new block.
2- block:: is the current block which we are trying to mine using the blockchain class functions. Every block has it's own set of key value pair which are 'index', 'timestamp', 'proof', 'previous_hash'
3- new_proof:: is the value we are trying to find to be able to mine a new block.

# Main functionality of Blockchain class
1- fun __init__:: is the constructor of the Blockchain class, it initialize the chain list and create the very first block with proof of 1 and previous_hash equals to 0
2- fun create_block:: it creates a new block as a new istance of the Blockchain class.
3- fun get_previous_block:: is for getting the previous block from the chain list and using it's previous_hash for th minning process.
4- fun proof_of_work:: to proof that the current proof is thr right value using hashlib and sha256 operation for hashing and make sure that the end value starts with '0000'
5- fun hash:: using hashlib and sha256 operation for hashing values.
5- fun is_chain_valid:: to be able to check if the chain values and no fake vlaues.

# Part 2 - Mining our Blockchain

# Creating a Web App
using Flask.

# Creating a Blockchain
creating a new instance from the Blockchain class.

# Mining a new block
using that new blockchain use this web based function mine_block to mine a new block.
# Getting the full Blockchain
using that new blockchain use this web based function get_chain to get the full chain.
# Checking if the Blockchain is valid
using that new blockchain use this web based function is_valid to check is_chain_valid.
# Running the app
Run our app using the ide to be deployed and start testing it.

# Testing
through POST Man app for example try to:
1- http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_chain
which will initiate the chain and create the first block
2- http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine_block
which will mine a new block
3- http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_chain
which will get the new chain after minning that new block form the preious step
4- repeate minning step 2 for 5 times for example
5- http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_chain again
6- http://127.0.0.1:5000/is_valid
to check if your chain is valid

# Dependencies
Works with Python 3.6
Anaconda's Python distribution contains all the dependencies for the code to run..
Make sure of installing Flask.
